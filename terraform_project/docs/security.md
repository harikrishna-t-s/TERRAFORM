# Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security guidelines and best practices for this infrastructure project.

## Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**
   - Multiple layers of security controls
   - No single point of failure
   - Redundant security measures

2. **Least Privilege**
   - Minimal required permissions
   - Role-based access control
   - Regular permission reviews

3. **Zero Trust**
   - No implicit trust
   - Verify all access attempts
   - Continuous validation

4. **Security by Design**
   - Security built into architecture
   - Automated security controls
   - Proactive security measures

## Security Controls

### Network Security
- VPC with public and private subnets
- Security groups and NACLs
- VPC endpoints for AWS services
- Network ACLs for subnet protection
- DDoS protection with AWS Shield

### Access Control
- IAM roles with least privilege
- MFA for all users
- Regular access reviews
- Session management
- Password policies

### Data Protection
- KMS encryption for data at rest
- TLS for data in transit
- S3 bucket encryption
- RDS encryption
- Secrets management

### Monitoring and Detection
- GuardDuty for threat detection
- CloudWatch for monitoring
- Security Hub for compliance
- AWS Config for configuration
- CloudTrail for audit logs

## Security Standards

### Compliance Frameworks
- CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark
- PCI DSS requirements
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- ISO 27001 controls

### Security Controls
1. **Identity and Access Management**
   - MFA enforcement
   - Password policies
   - Access key rotation
   - Role-based access

2. **Network Security**
   - VPC configuration
   - Security groups
   - NACLs
   - VPC endpoints

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encryption standards
   - Key management
   - Backup procedures
   - Data classification

4. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Log retention
   - Alert thresholds
   - Audit trails
   - Compliance reporting
